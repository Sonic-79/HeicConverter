# HeicConverter
A python script that converts heic images to JPG with optional limitation to 1080p size

Since I actually cannot code, this was done using AI.
The Script does work, but this repository is meant as a playground for me to get familiar using Github.

To Use the Script you will need to have python 3 and a few libraries (pillow, pillow_heif and PyQt5)
You can get the libraries by executing:

pip install pillow pillow_heif PyQt5

(I did pip3 install ... on my Mac but pip is what the AI suggested)
